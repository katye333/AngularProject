<!-- AppComponent is the parent component -->

<!-- Parent Component is listening for the features selected event and then
it will execute the onNavigate() function call -->

<!-- $event refers to the event data of the selected feature -->
<!-- header is only used in the AppComponent so we could add it to the coreModule  -->
<app-header (featureSelected)="onNavigate($event)"></app-header>
